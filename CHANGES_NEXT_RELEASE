 - Fix: Correct rendering of response to convop "POST /v1/contextEntities/{entityId::id}/attributes/{attributeName} (Issue #772)
- Fix: All convenience operations to use the service routines of standard operations (Issue #117)
- Fix: Made 'POST /v1/contextEntities/{entityId::id}' and 'POST /v1/contextEntities' accept entity::id and entity::type
       in both payload and URL, as long as the values coincide.
- Fix: A few more of the 'responses without entityId::type filled in' found and fixed (Issue #585)
- Fix: The convenience operations "/v1/contextAttributes/{entity::id}/attributes" now share implementation with
       convenience operations "/v1/contextAttributes/{entity::id}" and are thus 100% identical.
- Fix: The convenience operation "PUT /v1/contextAttributes/{entity::id}/attributes/{attribute::name}" had a bug
       about the metadata in the update, this error has been fixed.
- Fix: A registerContext request that uses associations must specify "attributeAssociations" instead of "attributes" to be consistent with DiscoveContextAvailability messages (Issue #823).
- Add: new CLI parameter -timeout to specify DB connection timeout in the case of using MongoDB replica sets (Issue #589).
